# Express and Ejs

## let app = express(); //here object of express gets created  and express() is a factory method

Yes, you're correct! When you use `let app = express();` in a Node.js application, you're creating an instance of an Express application, and `express()` acts as a factory function.

### **Understanding `express()` as a Factory Function**

- **Factory Function:** In JavaScript, a factory function is a function that returns a new object. Unlike a constructor function, which is invoked using the `new` keyword, a factory function is called directly and returns an instance of an object.

- **`express()` in Express.js:** When you call `express()`, it creates and returns a new Express application object. This object (`app`) is an instance of an Express application, and it provides methods to define routes, handle HTTP requests, set middleware, listen on ports, etc.

### **Example of `express()` Usage**

Here’s how it typically looks in a basic Express.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');

// Create an instance of an Express application
let app = express();

// Define a route handler for the root URL ('/')
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server on port 3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### **What Happens When You Call `express()`?**

- **Instantiation:** The `express()` function creates a new instance of an Express application. This instance is an object that holds the entire application’s configuration, middleware, and routing information.

- **Method Availability:** The `app` object returned by `express()` has a number of methods available to it, including:
  - `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, `app.delete()`: To define route handlers for different HTTP methods.
  - `app.use()`: To add middleware functions.
  - `app.listen()`: To start the server and listen for incoming requests.

### **Why is `express()` a Factory Function?**

- **Convenience:** By using a factory function, Express simplifies the creation of an application instance. Instead of requiring you to manually create an instance of a specific class, the `express()` function abstracts that process and gives you a ready-to-use application object.

- **Flexibility:** Factory functions allow the underlying implementation to change without affecting the way you create instances. This means that Express can internally optimize or modify how the application object is created without requiring changes in the way developers instantiate their apps.

### **Summary**

- `express()` is a **factory function** in Express.js that creates and returns an instance of an Express application.
- When you call `let app = express();`, you’re creating a new `app` object that you can use to define routes, add middleware, and start your server.
- This approach simplifies the creation of an Express application and provides a flexible way to manage your server's behavior.
