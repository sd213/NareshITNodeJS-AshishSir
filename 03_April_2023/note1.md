# what is the right order to use different methods in node

## In a Node.js application, especially when using Express.js, thereâ€™s a recommended order for using different methods and setting up your application. Following a logical order helps in ensuring that middleware functions, routes, and error handling work as expected"."

### **Typical Order of Methods in an Express Application**

1. **`require` Statements and Imports:**
   - First, you import all the necessary modules and packages that your application needs.
   - This includes the core Node.js modules, third-party modules, and your own modules.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const path = require('path');
     const dotenv = require('dotenv');
     const morgan = require('morgan');
     const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
     ```

2. **Environment Configuration (Optional):**
   - Load environment variables early using `dotenv` or any other configuration mechanism.
   - This should be done before you configure the app, so these variables are available throughout your app.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     dotenv.config();
     ```

3. **Initialize Express App:**
   - After importing the necessary modules, initialize your Express application.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const app = express();
     ```

4. **App-Level Configurations (`app.set`):**
   - Set various configurations for the app, such as the view engine, views path, or any custom settings.
   - These configurations need to be set before the app starts processing requests.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
     app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
     app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);
     ```

5. **Middleware Setup:**
   - Add any middleware functions that need to be applied globally across the app.
   - This includes logging, body parsing, static file serving, session management, etc.
   - Middlewares are executed in the order they are defined, so make sure to place them in the correct order.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     app.use(morgan('dev'));  // Logging middleware
     app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })); // Body parser middleware
     app.use(bodyParser.json());
     app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); // Serve static files
     ```

6. **Routing (Defining Routes):**
   - After middleware setup, define your application's routes. This includes the routes for handling different HTTP methods and URLs.
   - Use `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, `app.delete()`, etc., to define routes.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
         res.render('index', { title: 'Home Page' });
     });

     app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
         // Handle form submission
         res.send('Form Submitted');
     });
     ```

7. **Error Handling Middleware:**
   - Define error-handling middleware at the end of all route definitions. This middleware will catch and process any errors that occur during request handling.
   - This is done using `app.use()` with four arguments (err, req, res, next).
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
         console.error(err.stack);
         res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
     });
     ```

8. **Start the Server (`app.listen`):**
   - Finally, start the server by listening on a specified port.
   - This should be the last step in your app setup process.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const port = app.get('port');
     app.listen(port, () => {
         console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
     });
     ```

### **Summary of the Recommended Order:**

1. **`require` statements and imports:** Import necessary modules and packages.
2. **Environment Configuration:** Load environment variables (e.g., using `dotenv`).
3. **Initialize Express App:** Create an Express application instance.
4. **App-Level Configurations (`app.set`):** Set configurations like view engine, views path, etc.
5. **Middleware Setup:** Add middleware functions for logging, parsing, static files, etc.
6. **Routing (Defining Routes):** Define routes using `app.get`, `app.post`, etc.
7. **Error Handling Middleware:** Add error-handling middleware at the end.
8. **Start the Server (`app.listen`):** Start the server on a specific port.

By following this order, you ensure that your Node.js/Express application is configured correctly and runs smoothly, with all middleware and routes functioning as expected.
